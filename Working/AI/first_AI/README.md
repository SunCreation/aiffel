# Rock\_Paper\_Scissor

My first AI is rock\_paper\_scissor Classifier.
It's Python file, FAI.py that there is here.
It should be upgraded more. And I'll make it.
You should download whole filefolder 'Working' to try it, FAI.py.
If you download this folder at home directory, it's easy to execute.
But you don't have to. Just execute python3 FAI.py then you can try it.
